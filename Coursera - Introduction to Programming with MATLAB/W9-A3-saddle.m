%%% Week 09 - Final Assignment 1: Saddle Points
% Find the saddle points of a matrix.

% Write a function called 'saddle' that finds saddle points in the input matrix 'M'. For the purposes of this problem:
% A saddle point is defined as an element whose value is greater than or equal to every element in its row,
% and less than or equal to every element in its column. Note that there may be more than one saddle point in 'M'.
% Return a matrix called 'indices' that has exactly two columns.
% Each row of indices corresponds to one saddle point with the first element of the row containing the row index of the saddle point,
% and the second element containing the column index. If there is no saddle point in 'M', then 'indices' is the empty array.

function [indices] = saddle(M)

    numel(Z(1,:))
